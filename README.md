# Working-Schedule

## About The Project

This project is designed to create an efficient work schedule generator, tailored to meet the needs of any organization. The primary objectives of the project include:

1. Employee Database Management:
- Maintains a comprehensive database of employees, including their personal details, availability.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for adding, updating, and managing employee records.

2. Work Schedule Generation:
- Automatically generates work schedules based on predefined criteria such as employee availability, required shift coverage, and specific employee skills.
- Ensures fair distribution of shifts among employees while considering their preferences and constraints.
